\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\textbf{Why index is useful, why people care about indices}

Many concepts relevant to decision making cannot be directly measured,
however, they are crucial for resource allocation, early prevention, and
other operational purpose. For example, fire authorities would be
interested to quantify fire risk since bushfires can have a huge impact
on monetary loss, health, and the local ecosystem. Climatologists would
be interested in monitoring the change in global climate since
variability in atmospheric and oceanic conditions has a direct impact on
global weather and climate. Usually this concept of interest is
associated with more than one variables and these variables need to be
integrated to make decisions on the subject matter. A common approach to
quantify concepts like these is to construct an index using these
relevant variables. This allows researchers to compare the quantity of
interest across entities (i.e.~countries, regions) and also cross time.

\textbf{Define what is an index, what is not}

The meaning of indices varies across disciplines and in this article, an
index is defined as a tool to quantify a concept of interest that does
not have a direct measure. The concept of interest doesn't have a direct
measure can because it is impractical to measure at the population
level. For example, it would be nearly impossible to include all the
available stocks in the market to characterise stock market behavior, so
indices like Dow Jones Industrial Average, S\&P 500, and Nasdaq
Composite select a representative set of stocks to measure the overall
market behavior. Also belonging to this category are the economic
indices like the Consumer Price Index, where price changes of a basket
of items are weighted to measure inflation. The lack of direct measure
could also because the concept itself is an unobservable human
construction, rather than a physical quantity that can be measured. Many
natural hazard and social concepts falls into this category. This
includes drought indices constructed from meteorological, agricultural,
hydrological, and social-economic variables, e.g.~Standardised
Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al. 1993) and Aggregated Drought
Index (ADI) (Keyantash and Dracup 2004) among others. Social development
indices like Human Development Index (United Nations Development
Programme 2022) and Global Liveability Index (Economist Intelligence
Unit 2019) measure various aspects of the quality of human capital and
urban life.

Despite many quantity having the term \emph{index} in their name, they
cannot be technically classified as indices according to the definition
given above. The reason for these quantities to lose their index
memberships is that they are variables can be accurately measured given
the instrument precision. This includes quantities like precipitation of
the driest month or percentage of days when maximum temperature is below
10th percentile. They are measures of precipitation and percentage of
days under specific conditions (dries month, maximum temperature below
10th percentile). They are variables, or indicators, that can be used to
construct indices but are not indices themselves. Similarly, a set of
remote sensing indices are not indices, since they are measures of
electromagnetic wave reflectance. This includes Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Tucker 1979), derived from the ratio of
difference over sum on two segments in the spectrum, also called band:
near-infrared (NIR) and red. So are the ``indices'' derived from NDVI,
e.g.~Vegetation Condition Index (Kogan 1995). Notice that this does not
exclude all the construction derived from remotes sensor variables to be
valid indices. For example, Vegetation Drought Response Index (Brown et
al. 2008) is a valid index since it integrates climate, satellite, and
biophysical variables to quantify vegetation stress.

FYI:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vegetation Condition Index = (NDVI - NDVI\_min)/ (NDVI\_max -
  NDVI\_min)
\item
  A measure is a variable, but is not an index.
\item
  Not all multivariate quantities are indices (i.e.~those remote sensor
  measures). It is possible that an index is constructed from a single
  variable (i.e.~SPI).
\item
  Indices is not a single/ set of measures
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What is the problem with current workflow on index construction}

There has not yet been a standardised workflow on index construction.
For simple indices, users may be able to work out the calculation from
the equations or workflow provided, while for more complicated
construction, software is not even available for open-source
consumption. Even when the software implementation is available, most
indices are computed through a single index command, for example, the
package \texttt{SPEI} provides two drought indices: SPI and SPEI through
function \texttt{spi()} and \texttt{spei()}. This software design
focuses on the name of the index and includes all the steps in a single
index function. With this design, there is little room for modification.
For example, fit a new distribution that is not provided in the initial
code. Also, when scaled to a large number of indices, it increases the
cognitive load of remembering hundreds of index names. A better approach
is to modularise these steps and construct a pipeline for users to build
indices through choosing different building blocks from each module.
With this design, users focus on the operations involved in the index
construction. If an operation from another index is useful, users can
borrow it to modify an existing index.

\textbf{who would benefit from this paper}

The article contributes a pipeline framework to construct general
indices.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  domain scientists who propose new indices and directly use indices in
  analysis. {[}use multiple indices to compare{]}
\item
  general scientists who uses indices as part of analysis, modelling
  process. Official indices are usually published in a public table with
  values calculated. Although methods of calculation are provided by the
  relevant index provider, raw data and scripts are usually not
  available for public consumption. The pipeline proposed in the paper
  opens up the possibility for general scientists to construct indices
  customised to their research purpose.
\item
  decision makers, towards understand the
\item
  statisticians, so as to {[}draw focus/ advocate{]} on statistical
  workflow and software design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: the concept of data
pipeline in R is reviewed in Section~\ref{sec-data-pipeline-in-r}.
Section~\ref{sec-a-pipeline-for-building-statistical-indices} presents
the data pipeline for index construction.
Section~\ref{sec-incorporating-new-buliding-blocks-into-the-pipeline}
explains how to include a new building block in each pipeline module.
Examples are given in Section~\ref{sec-examples} to demonstrate the
index construction with the pipeline built.

\hypertarget{sec-tidy-data}{%
\subsection{Tidy data}\label{sec-tidy-data}}

Before the concept of tidy data (Wickham 2014), tabular data arrive at
data analysts in all different ways. Different analysts would write
customised scripts for analysing the specific data. These scripts can be
extended to other data analysed by the same people or group but this is
not generalizable directly to another dataset. When the tidy data
concept comes, variables and values are arranged so that 1) Each
variable forms a column, 2) Each observation forms a row, and; 3) Each
type of observational unit forms a table. With this specific layout,
wrangling on tabular data can be standardised into a grammar of data
manipulation in \texttt{dplyr} (Wickham et al. 2022).

A similar issue happens with index construction where researchers
construct their own indices in their own ways and there has not yet been
a tidy principle on index construction. Also, this tidy principle on
index construction is more complex than those in tidy data and the
\texttt{dplyr} package. It has to encompass the workflow of
transformation from the raw data towards the final index series.

\hypertarget{sec-data-pipeline}{%
\subsection{Data pipeline}\label{sec-data-pipeline}}

Constructing a pipeline that divides a complex procedure into steps that
can be concatenated has been adopted widely in the R community.

The data pipeline in interactive graphics is a set of steps that
transform the raw data to the plots displayed on the screen. The initial
pipeline proposed by Buja et al. (1988) involves the following steps:
non-linear transformation, variables standardization, randomization,
projection engine, and viewporting. The initial pipeline proposed by
Buja et al. (1988) involves the following steps: non-linear
transformation, variables standardization, randomization, projection
engine, and viewporting. Another example in the early work of pipeline
by Sutherland et al. (2000) describes a three-step pipeline: variable
standardization, dimension reduction, and scaling data into the viewing
window. This pipeline also includes the transformation on spatial and
temporal variables, i.e.~computing time lag on temporal variables. This
pipeline also includes the transformation on spatial and temporal
variables, i.e.~computing time lag on temporal variables. Wickham et al.
(2009) argues that whether made explicit or not, pipeline has to be
presented in every graphics program and breaking down graphic rendering
into steps is also beneficial for understand the implementation and
compare between different graphic systems.

The data pipeline concept is further enhanced by the pipe operator
(\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}) in R where a set of operations, or steps,
can be chained together to form a set of instructions.

A more recent data pipeline is tidymodels (Kuhn and Wickham 2020), a set
of packages for machine learning models following the tidyverse
principles (Wickham et al. 2019). Steps: Exploratory data analysis
(EDA), feature engineering, model tuning and selection, and model
evaluation.

\hypertarget{sec-a-pipeline-for-building-statistical-indices}{%
\section{A pipeline for building statistical
indices}\label{sec-a-pipeline-for-building-statistical-indices}}

The construction of natural hazard indices also follows a set of steps,
which is usually illustrated using a flowchart in the paper. However,
every researcher follows a certain design philosophy and steps taken in
the index constructed by different researchers are not aligned. This
discourages experiment with multiple indices. Initiate a new workflow
when computing a new index.

The most popular indices (i.e.~SPI, SPEI, etc) have existing software
implementation (\texttt{SPEI}) to be applied to a different set of data.

constructing time series index should also be encapsulated in my
framework

Here we assume a concept of interest is determined, relevant variables/
indicators are identified and available to construct indices.

\hypertarget{raw-data}{%
\subsection{Raw data}\label{raw-data}}

\textbf{Another section on original data directly downloaded, can have
different spatial resolution, temporal granularity, data quality
problem. After processing them and align them together they become the
``raw data''}

The data used to construct the natural hazard index usually have three
dimensions, one for location, one for time, and one for multivariate.
Mathematically, it can be written as \(X_{j, s, t}\), where
\(j = 1, 2, \cdots, J\) for variable, \(s = 1, 2, \cdots, S\) for
location, and \(t = 1, 2, \cdots, T\) for time.

The location \(s\) can refer to vector points or areas characterised by
longitude-latitude coordinates, or raster cells obtained from satellite
images.

The time dimension \(t\) can be daily, weekly, biweekly (14-16 days),
monthly, or even quarterly

Variables

This multidimensional array structure is commonly used in geospatial
analysis

Given the variety of data sources at different spatial resolution and
temporal granularity, the raw data may first come in multiple pieces.
Sometimes, even a considerable amount of work is needed to align the
spatial and temporal extent of multivariate data.

A notation for different variables have different spatial and temporal
granularity \(X_{j_1, s_1, t_1}\)???

The purpose of normalising is for cross-comparison. This step can get
criticism from analysts for \ldots{}

specifically for converting from a fitted distribution to normal score
via reverse CDF function, non-parametric formula, or empirical
approximation, a common step in many index: SPI, SSI, Z score. The
purpose of normalising is to convert the index into a standardised
